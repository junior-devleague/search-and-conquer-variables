2.  Students may not shout out loud to find their matching card
3.  Students must complete all sets of variables

### How to play

* Each student is given an index card containing either variable names or values
* Each student must figure out whether the card they have are variable names or values
* If a student has a card containing variable names, they must find the matching values, and vice versa
* When the students find their matching card they must get onto their computers and open up a text editor or repl, and create the variables
* When a pair of students are done, they must pass their cards to the next pair until everyone has created all variables from each set
